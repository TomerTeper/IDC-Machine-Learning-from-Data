# HW3: MAP Classifier

## Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) classifier. The project focuses on computing class posterior probabilities and making predictions using a MAP classifier, specifically leveraging the Naive Bayes algorithm. The Naive Bayes algorithm assumes conditional independence between features given the class, which simplifies the computation of posterior probabilities. 

Additionally, the project includes methods for evaluating classifier accuracy, comparing Naive Bayes performance, and analyzing feature dependencies in the dataset.
