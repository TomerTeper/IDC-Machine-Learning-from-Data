---

### Homework 1: Linear Regression
**Overview:**  
This project implements linear regression for a housing dataset from King County, USA. The dataset contains 5,000 observations with 18 features, where the target value is the house price. The notebook walks through the preprocessing steps and modeling required to predict house prices.

### Homework 2: Decision Tree Classifier Implementation
**Overview:**  
This project implements a basic decision tree algorithm in Python. It includes functions for calculating decision tree metrics like Gini impurity and entropy and defines a class-based structure for building and working with decision trees.

### Homework 3: MAP Classifier
**Overview:**  
The goal of this project is to implement a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) classifier. It focuses on computing class posterior probabilities and making predictions using a Naive Bayes algorithm, which assumes conditional independence between features given the class. The project also includes methods for evaluating classifier accuracy, comparing Naive Bayes performance, and analyzing feature dependencies.

### Homework 4: Logistic Regression, Bayes and EM
**Overview:**  
This project covers several core machine learning techniques, focusing on both supervised and unsupervised learning. The key tasks include:
- Feature Selection
- Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Cross Validation
- Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices

### Homework 5: PAC Learnable
**Overview:**  
This exercise implements the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model. It provides a formal definition of learnability, ensuring an algorithm can learn a hypothesis close to the true concept with high probability after training on sufficient samples. The assignment also covers error bounds, generalization, and VC-dimension, combining practical coding and mathematical analysis.

### Homework 6: Clustering - K-means
**Overview:**  
This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm and its variant, K-means++. The task involves applying these algorithms to perform color image quantization, a process that compresses images by reducing the number of colors.
