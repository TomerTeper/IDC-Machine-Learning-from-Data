# HW5: PAC Learnable

## Overview
This exercise focuses on implementing elements of the **Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)** learning model, a foundational concept in machine learning theory. The PAC framework provides a formal definition of learnability, ensuring that an algorithm can, with high probability, learn a hypothesis that is close to the true concept after training on a sufficient number of samples.

In this notebook, you will:
- Explore **sample complexity** and how it impacts learning.
- Implement algorithms that produce PAC guarantees for error rates.
- Write efficient, vectorized code using `numpy` and `scipy`.

The exercise also includes theoretical components where you'll analyze error bounds, generalization, and VC-dimension, providing both practical coding and mathematical analysis.
